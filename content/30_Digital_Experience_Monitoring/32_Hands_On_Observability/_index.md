## Transactions View

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; Use the steps below to explore the **Transactions View**.

1. Click on the **Transactions** view
2. Ensure that **Transaction Time** is the **selected metric**
3. Hover over the **red circle** in the northeast region of the USA on the map
4. Click on **Chicago, IL** to select that agent

If you hover on each of the circles in the map, you will see a list of transactions and the completion time from the geographic location. ThousandEyes provides cloud agents in locations throughout the world on multiple provider networks for instant use by customers.

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; Next click on **Waterfall**.

This display represents what the user in Chicago sees in terms of the response time for the transactions of the application. You can see the steps the user goes through and all the components involved in the transactions and the amount of time it takes to complete any of the responses by scrolling down the page.

<span style="color: #143c76;"><i class='fas fa-circle fa-sm'></i></span>&nbsp; Scroll down the page to see the actual paths taken.

Looking through the paths there appears to be no issues, so you can assume that the network is not contributing to any problems accessing the front-end of the application.
