**While on a Digital Transformation journey, Erin is also concerned about the experience an end-user has while using the application from anywhere around the globe. She appreciates the importance of global Internet health if her organization wants a highly available network service and optimal digital experience for users.**

Perceptions of digital experience is becoming mission critical. Because of this, she wants to monitor it to understand and better manage the complex environment. She is looking for a tool that can provide proactive visibility into the delivery of any web application across any network. This tool must provide the cross-layer visibility and synthetics she needs to gain insight into performance and quickly troubleshoot issues from real user vantage points. To understand how external factors affect the web applications, she needs visibility into routing, end-to-end paths, performance (such as latency or loss) and hop-by-hop metrics.

Erin and her team want to work and solve the following pain points:

- Understand and improve application experiences for their customers
- See beyond their organization’s edge and get visibility into networks and external dependencies outside of their control
- Monitor application availability and usability correlated with network connectivity from the perspective of your customers
- Ensure business continuity by proactively monitoring the performance of customer-facing web applications
- Extend RCA (MTTI/MTTR) for network and internet related problems
- Pinpoint issues in real time, dramatically improve MTTR and reduce the business impact of network and application anomalies
- Monitor and troubleshoot connectivity and network performance to IaaS, PaaS services while understanding 3rd party service dependencies

We’ll walk through some hands-on exercises with ThousandEyes to see how it give us deep visibility into the network.
